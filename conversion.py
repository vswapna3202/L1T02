# This program declares variables of data types float, integer and string and converts them
# to a different data type
#Pseudocode
# Set variable num1 as 99.23 (float) and then cast it to integer
# Set variable num2 as 23 (integer) and then cast it to float
# Set variable num3 as 150 (integer) and then cast it to string
# Set variable string1 as "100" (string) and then cast it to integer
# print num1
# print num2
# print num3
# print string1
# Python program below:

# Declare variable num1 with value 99.23 and cast it to int
num1 = int(99.23)

# Declare variable num2 with value 23 and cast it to float
num2 = float(23)

# Declare variable num3 with value 150 and cast it to str
num3 = str(150)

# Declare variable string1 with value "100" and cast it to int
string1 = int("100")

# print num1, num2, num3 and string1 in separate print statements so all are printed
# in new lines. 

print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)
print(string1)
